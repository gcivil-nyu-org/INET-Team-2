        <div class="container">
            <p> Our team pulled publicly available datasets containing information we believe is fundamental or
                detrimental to healthy, peaceful living.</p>

            <h3>NYC 311 Dataset</h3>
            <p>This 311 data contains information about
                more than 24 million service requests made since 2010. For those who aren’t familiar,
                311 is a phone number used in the U.S. that allows callers to access non-emergency municipal services,
                report problems to government agencies, and request information.</p>
            <p>From this dataset we collected reports related to Residential Noise Complaints, Dirty Condition
                Complaints, Sanitation Complaints, and Waste Disposal Requests.</p>

            <h3>DOF Construction Permits</h3>
            <p>The Department of Buildings (DOB) issues permits for construction and demolition activities in the City
                of New York. The construction industry must submit an application to DOB with details of the
                construction job they would like to complete. The primary types of application, aka job type, are: New
                Building, Demolition, and Alterations Type 1, 2, and 3. Each job type can have multiple work types, such
                as general construction, boiler, elevator, and plumbing. Each work type will receive a separate permit.
                Each row/record in this dataset represents the life cycle of one permit for one work type. The dataset
                is
                updated daily with new records, and each existing record will be updated as the permit application moves
                through the approval process to reflect the latest status of the application.</p>

            <p>
                We estimated scores on the impact the work will have, higher scores mean more impact.
            <ul>
                <h5>Actitivties and estimated relative impact:</h5>
                <li>
                    A1 = Alteration Type I, A major alteration that will change the use, egress, or occupancy of the
                    building.
                    <h6>IMPACT = 4</h6>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A2 = Alteration Type II, An application with multiple types of work that do not affect the use,
                    egress, or occupancy of the building.
                    <h6>IMPACT = 3</h6>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A3 = Alteration Type III, One type of minor work that doesn't affect the use, egress, or occupancy
                    of the building.
                    <h6>IMPACT = 2</h6>

                <li>
                    NB = New Building, An application to build a new structure. "NB" cannot be selected if any existing
                    building elements are to remain—for example a part of an old foundation, a portion of a façade that
                    will be incorporated into the construction, etc.
                    <h6>IMPACT = 10</h6>
                </li>
                <li>
                    DM = Demolition, An application to fully or partially demolish an existing building.

        <h3>NYC Street Tree Census 2015</h3>
        <p>Street tree data from the TreesCount! 2015 Street Tree Census, conducted by volunteers and staff organized by
            NYC Parks & Recreation and partner organizations. Tree data collected includes tree species, diameter and
            perception of health. Accompanying blockface data is available indicating status of data collection and data
            release citywide.</p>
        <p>From this dataset we simply summed the number of street trees in every zipcode, more trees improve the

        <h3>NYC Parks Properties</h3>
        <p>This dataset identifies property managed partially or solely by NYC Parks. This data has been produced in
            whole or part using secondary data. Data accuracy is limited by the scale and accuracy of the original
            sources. Site-specific conditions should be field-verified.

            Records are added as more land is designated under NYC Parks’ jurisdiction. Each record represents an
            acquisition.</p>
